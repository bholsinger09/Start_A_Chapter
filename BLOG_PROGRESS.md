# Blog Feature Progress Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- localStorage authentication fix (user vs currentUser)  
- Blog form rendering when authenticated
- Blog tab visible in navigation
- API endpoints working (/api/blogs GET/POST)
- Production deployment via sed patches
- Successful blog creation via API test

## üîß IDENTIFIED ISSUE  
Frontend BlogCreate component needs to:
1. Fetch Member ID for authenticated user
2. Send author: {id: memberId} instead of author: {username: 'code_monkey'}

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS
1. Update BlogCreate.vue to fetch user Member ID
2. Fix author field format in blog submission
3. Test end-to-end blog creation via UI
4. Deploy final fixes

## üìù TECHNICAL DETAILS
- Authentication: localStorage.getItem('user') = {username, action, loginTime}
- Members API: /api/members returns Member entities with id, firstName, lastName
- Blog API expects: {title, content, published, author: {id: <memberId>}}

Blog feature is 95% complete - just needs proper author ID mapping!
